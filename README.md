## About Cellular and Mobile Communication

**Cellular communication (CC)** is the most popular way to connect people together for real-time communication and data transmission. CC systems have an enormous number of users, and large amounts of data, including user- and system-oriented data, are generated in CC systems every day. To continually provide better service, CC systems are encountering new challenges, such as unbalanced crowd communication behaviors of users and congestion from huge requests of high-quality video transmission. It has become an emerging research topic to study the huge data generated from CC systems and to predict the behaviors of CC systems, so that better quality of services can be provided. In particular, spatial big data analytics, which primarily handles spatial data, is important, because most data generated from CC systems are spatiotemporal-oriented data, and analyses of these data can significantly support the development of CC systems. In this chapter, we comprehensively survey methodologies of spatial big data analytics, study possible applications to support CC systems with spatial big data analytics, and highlight challenging issues.
